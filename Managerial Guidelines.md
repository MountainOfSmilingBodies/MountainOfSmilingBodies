When Finn died while working with Mountain of Smiling Bodies, the Qliphoth Counter lowered.

When a wounded employee entered the Containment Unit, the Qliphoth Counter lowered.

When the work result was Bad, the Qliphoth Counter decreased.

When 10 employees die inside the facility, the Qliphoth Counter will lower. However, deaths caused by Execution Bullets were not recognized.

While Mountain of Smiling Bodies is escaping, it will show sensitive reactions to corpses. During suppression, ensure that no one dies due to the Abnormality; if casualties do happen, try to keep Mountain of Smiling Bodies away from the dead.

If Mountain of Smiling Bodies’s suppression could not be completed on the previous level, you must be very careful to prevent any death inside the section where Mountain of Smiling Bodies is located.

After other entities spawned from Mountain of Smiling Bodies’s main body while escaping, reducing its HP to 0 did not fully suppress it. Mountain of Smiling Bodies will only be quelled by attacking the main body after continuously reducing its HP and defeating the other spawned entities.
